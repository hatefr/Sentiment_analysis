# Sentiment_analysis

This project aims to impelement sentiment analysis on the  [HappyDB](https://www.kaggle.com/ritresearch/happydb) corpus from Kaggle. The classifications are affection, exercise, bonding, nature, leisure, achievement, enjoy_the_moment. The data set contains more than 100,000 happy moments crowd-sourced via Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk. 

The notebook consists of the following parts:

- Data preparation and visualization

- Data pre-processing

- Building ML models

- Hyperparameter optimization

- Final remarks and conclusions

Four different models are used for classification data: Decision Tree, SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. I will also explore and report top words for each sentiment with the highest positive/negative effects. Lastly, I will test the best trained model on some of my own personal messages.  

So, let's get started.
